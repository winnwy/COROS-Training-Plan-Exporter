  "Y9075": "What is Heart Rate Variability (HRV)\nHeart rate variability (HRV) measures time fluctuation corresponding to two consecutive heartbeats and is a normal \"irregular\" state of heartbeat.\n\n\nWhy is HRV used for assessment?\nShort-term HRV balance (daily HRV) is your body's response to current stress. Long-term HRV balance (HRV over time) can reflect your overall health, whether you are chronically stressed, fatigued, or ill.\n\n\nWhat is Overnight HRV?\nHRV is a measurable reflection of the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Your body is in a normal and good state of stabilization when it is balanced. When it is out of balance, your body is in an unstable and abnormal state, usually accompanied by fatigue, as a result of a major stressor. Overnight HRV tracks your normal or abnormal state, allowing you to make informed decisions about your work, life, and exercise routines.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the purpose of Overnight HRV?\nOvernight HRV will help you plan your activities in a more logical and effective manner. Take breaks when you are under increased stress to avoid increasing the burden on your body. When you are in good shape, you can perform more challenging work and training to improve efficiency and performance.\n\n\nHow to use Overnight HRV?\nConsistently sleeping with your watch on will provide you with a more accurate Overnight HRV. The following information is available to you.\n\n\n1. Average HRV for last night\nWhen you wear the watch while sleeping, the algorithm automatically calculates the average value of RMSSD for the entire sleep period, i.e. the average HRV from the previous night. RMSSD is one of the most commonly used HRV metrics because it is stable, less affected by breathing, and more sensitive to changes in neurologic status. COROS uses RMSSD to calculate and assess HRV.\n\n\n2. HRV normal range\nCOROS uses your last 30 days of HRV data to calculate the \"normal range.\" Obtaining the HRV \"normal range\" for the first time requires you to sleep with the watch on for at least 5 nights. Due to the small sample size, there may be deviations in the normal range at this time. The normal range will be updated and become more accurate as more sleep data is collected. \n\n3. Overnight HRV results\nIf your average HRV last night was lower or higher than the normal range, your body may be fatigued. The results of the Overnight HRV are as follows: \n•Elevated\nHRV is elevated above your normal range. This typically indicates you are more relaxed, but please pay attention to other physiological factors.\n•Normal\nHRV is within your normal range. Your body is in good condition, proceed as planned.\n•Reduced\nHRV is slightly lower than normal. This typically indicates your body is under stress, consider additional rest.\n•Low\nHRV is significantly lower than normal range. Your body is in a very stressed condition, and taking additional rest is recommended.\n\nOvernight HRV limitations\nHRV reacts to the autonomic nervous system's condition, but the autonomic nervous system is insufficient to react to every bodily state, including muscle fatigue. Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) is a common symptom of muscle fatigue, which is generally defined as the inflammatory response of the muscles as a result of exercise. After exercise, DOMS usually peaks on days two or three and goes away on its own in five days. As a result, even though the Overnight HRV may show a normal range, the muscles may still be sore, and it is recommended to refer to \"Recovery”at the same time.\n\nOvernight HRV and Recovery\nRecovery of the autonomic nervous system, recovery of energy, and recovery of muscles are the three primary categories of body recovery.  \nThe autonomic nervous system's level of recovery can be indicated by HRV, and the muscles' and energy sources' ability to recover can be indicated by physical strength. As a result, a more thorough recovery assessment result can be obtained by combining physical recovery and Overnight HRV.  The nervous system recovers the quickest, followed by the recovery of energy, and lastly, the recovery of muscles. The three types of recovery proceed in different ways. Even though Recovery may not have reached 100%, Overnight HRV may have returned to normal. \nConsequently, if your Recovery is poor but your Overnight HRV is within normal range, it indicates that your nervous system is in good health but that your muscle and energy recovery are still lacking. At this time, please focus primarily on the Recovery recommendations. All body systems are recuperating properly when your Overnight HRV is within the normal range and your physical strength is sufficient.\n\n\nWhy does my HRV fluctuate so much throughout the night?\nThis is a normal physiological phenomenon. HRV will change due to the influence of sleep stages and circadian rhythm, so HRV changes every moment, and it is normal to fluctuate within tens of ms.\n\n\nReasons for a lower HRV\nSome common factors in life (injury, illness, smoking, alcohol, intense work, bad moods, intense exercise, etc.) can all lead to a poor autonomic nervous system response that goes into a state of stress or fatigue, which can lower HRV while you sleep.\n\nHow to increase your HRV\nBreathing exercises, meditation, and other relaxation methods can actively relax the autonomic nervous system and temporarily elevate HRV.",

The power should start from the legs and pass through to the waist, shoulders and finally the arms to focus the power on the medicine ball, forming a coherent and explosive power output.\nCatch the medicine ball after it bounces and continue to repeat the movement.\n\n-Tip:\nPay attention to the coordination of the joints and the consistency of the movement.",

Keep your elbow close to your body during the process.\nWhile pulling up, the body naturally twists to the side of force generation, so that the opposite side of the body is as far away from the crossbar as possible, forming a posture similar to that of an archer drawing a bow. The body should remain stable at this point without excessive swaying or imbalance.\nKeep the chest of the power side as close to the crossbar as possible, and pause slightly at the highest point.\n\n-Tip:\nExhale as you pull up and inhale as you lower down.\nUse the contraction force of your back muscles to pull your body up, rather than relying solely on arm strength.",

  "Y1519": "Training Effect is determined by training load per minute and evaluates how your training impacts both your aerobic system (from cardio building activities) and anaerobic system (from high-intensity interval training). What divides these two groupings is your Lactate Threshold. Generally, a lower load per minute below the lactate threshold intensity will help your aerobic fitness and a higher load above lactate threshold intensity will improve your anaerobic fitness. Both the aerobic and anaerobic training effects have the same scale from 0-5+ or inefficient to overreaching.\n\nThere are 6 different types of aerobic and anaerobic training effects.\nInefficient (0-0.9): Minimal effect on fitness\nRecovering (1.0-1.9): Good for recovery but low on fitness improvement\nMaintaining (2.0-2.9): Maintaining fitness\nImproving (3.0-3.9): Improving fitness if repeated 2-4 times per week\nOptimized (4.0-4.9): Improving fitness efficiently if repeated 1-2 times per week\nOverreaching (5.0-5.9): Improving fitness significantly with sufficient recovery or may lead to overtraining.",

To aid in accuracy, make sure to set up your heart rate properly and upload your past training history. Race time predictions do not factor in variables such as weather, stress, or course difficulty. \n\nYou can also edit your race predictor on the COROS app if you recently started using EvoLab and want to receive accurate fitness evaluations sooner.

If your goal is to train hard but the 4-week intensity distribution shows that most of the training is easy, it is time to adjust your training focus and increase the intensity to spend more time in higher threshold pace zones.\n\nThere are 3 different intensity levels to categorize your road running.

Each workout tracked using a COROS device receives a training load score based on training impulse (TRIMP), a well-established method of quantifying training load using heart rate and activity time.

To better suit your training, you can edit the default zones or choose other heart rate zones such as max heart rate zones or heart rate reserve zones. Training at each zone has a unique effect on your body and fitness.
